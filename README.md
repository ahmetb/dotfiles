## Shell

Install oh-my-zsh: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh

## Package manager

- Install Homebrew &mdash;to `$HOME/.homebrew` instead of /usr/local:

      git clone https://github.com/Homebrew/brew.git $HOME/.homebrew

- Run `which brew` to confirm the one in home directory is picked up.
- Run `brew analytics off`

## Installing software manually

- Download Dropbox
  - Sign in 
  - Sync only 1Password
- Download iPassword 6
  - Choose .opvault file from Dropbox
  - Go to Software Licenses &rarr; open the 1Password license file
  - Accept to use 1Password Mini when prompted

## Installing software via Homebrew

All software installed on the system must be listed in `.Brewfile`. This is
symlinked at `~/.Brewfile` and used by `brew bundle`.

To install all the software, add it to `.Brewfile` and run:

    brew bundle --global

Some stuff will take long, in that case, identify which packages and update
`.Brewfile` to install them with `args: ['force-bottle']` or do a one-off
`brew install --force-bottle [pkg]` install.

Some things that require manual installation after Homebrew:

```sh
# if pip requires sudo, something is wrong, because the
# Homebrew bundle should install a $USER-writable over system-python.
    
pip install virtualenv
pip install virtualenvwrapper
```
